You can see the Mini_Project.ipynb how we trained the algorithm.
In final version you can see the arduino file used to run the program. Just replace the model.h in the arduino file to run the project. Then do pinching and twisting or poking motion using two sensors.








To be noted their might be a bug that allows the programm to be run only once on arduino before having to restart the computer. This is unfortunate, but I have not been able to fix it. So their is a problem of reproducability.
Also the project might not work depending on tensorflow light version. 
I have not been able to test it again before submitting please contact me if there is a problem.
